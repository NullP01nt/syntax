Installation of the syntax description for vim is very easy (for UNIX-derived systems, such as MacOSX or Linux).
Ensure that you have a folder called ".vim" (without the double quotes) in your home folder.
Then simply copy the ftdetect and syntax folders into that folder.

For windows systems, this might be different, if you can tell me how to, please report back via the Issues or something similar ;)
